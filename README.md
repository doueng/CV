## 42_projects

These are the projects that I have completed during my time at 42.
The projects are all written in accordance with the school style guide.
The style guide prohibites do-while loops, switch statements,

## [corewar](https://github.com/doueng/corewar)
In a group of four people we made our own Matrix themed version of the game Corewar.

To run the game you have to install libsndfile which is easiest done on mac with "brew install libsndfile".
Then add the absolute path of the library to the makefile in the vm folder.

Example :

LIBSND = /usr/local/Cellar/libsndfile/1.0.28/lib/libsndfile.1.dylib
