# 42_projects

These are the projects that I have completed during my time at 42.
The projects are all written in accordance to the school style guide.
The style guide prohibites things like do-while loops, switch statements,
for loops and alot of other things. The style guide is included as a pdf
in this repository (norme.en.pdf).

## [corewar](https://github.com/doueng/corewar)
In a group of four people we made our own Matrix themed version of the game Corewar.
To run you have to install libsndfile. Easiest done on mac with "brew install libsndfile".
Then add the absolute path of the library to the makefile in the vm folder.
Example :
  LIBSND = /usr/local/Cellar/libsndfile/1.0.28/lib/libsndfile.1.dylib
